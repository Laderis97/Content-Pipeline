# Admin Operations Guide - Manual Retry & System Management

This guide provides comprehensive procedures for administrative operations, manual retry capabilities, and system management for the Content Pipeline.

## üéØ Overview

The Content Pipeline includes robust admin capabilities for manual intervention, retry operations, and system management. This guide covers all administrative functions available to system administrators and authorized users.

## üîê Admin Authentication

### Service Role Access

Admin operations require service role authentication:

```bash
# Set your service role key
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key-here"

# Or use in curl commands
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/content-automation \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "admin_operation"}'
```

### Admin User Verification

All admin operations are logged with user identification:

```sql
-- View admin actions
SELECT admin_user, action, job_id, created_at, ip_address
FROM admin_retry_audit_log
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## üîÑ Manual Retry Operations

### 1. Retry Failed Jobs

#### Single Job Retry

**Identify Failed Job:**
```sql
-- Find failed jobs
SELECT id, topic, status, last_error, retry_count, created_at
FROM content_jobs
WHERE status = 'error'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Retry Specific Job:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/content-automation \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "admin_retry",
    "job_id": "job-uuid-here",
    "admin_user": "admin@example.com",
    "reason": "Manual retry after error resolution"
  }'
```

**Verify Retry Success:**
```sql
-- Check job status after retry
SELECT id, status, retry_count, last_error, updated_at
FROM content_jobs
WHERE id = 'job-uuid-here';
```

#### Bulk Job Retry

**Retry Multiple Failed Jobs:**
```bash
# Get list of failed job IDs
curl -X GET https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/content-automation \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "list_failed_jobs"}'

# Retry multiple jobs
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/content-automation \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "bulk_retry",
    "job_ids": ["job-uuid-1", "job-uuid-2", "job-uuid-3"],
    "admin_user": "admin@example.com",
    "reason": "Bulk retry after system maintenance"
  }'
```

### 2. Reset Stuck Jobs

#### Jobs Stuck in Processing

**Identify Stuck Jobs:**
```sql
-- Find jobs stuck in processing for more than 10 minutes
SELECT id, topic, status, claimed_at, created_at
FROM content_jobs
WHERE status = 'processing'
AND claimed_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes';
```

**Reset Stuck Jobs:**
```bash
# Run sweeper to reset all stuck jobs
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/sweeper \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"

# Or reset specific stuck job
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/content-automation \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "reset_stuck_job",
    "job_id": "job-uuid-here",
    "admin_user": "admin@example.com"
  }'
```

### 3. Override Retry Limits

#### Force Retry Beyond Limits

**Check Current Retry Count:**
```sql
SELECT id, topic, retry_count, last_error
FROM content_jobs
WHERE id = 'job-uuid-here';
```

**Force Retry:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/content-automation \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "force_retry",
    "job_id": "job-uuid-here",
    "admin_user": "admin@example.com",

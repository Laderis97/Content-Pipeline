### 4. Job Status Update ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Status: Needs Attention**

Job status update testing encountered a minor issue:

- **Response Code**: 204 (No Content)
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è FAILED
- **Issue**: PATCH request returning 204 instead of 200

**Analysis:**
- The 204 response code indicates the update was successful but no content was returned
- This is actually a valid HTTP response for successful updates
- The system is working correctly, but the test validation needs adjustment

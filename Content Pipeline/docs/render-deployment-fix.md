# Render Deployment Fix

## 🚨 Issue Identified
Render is looking for `package.json` in `/opt/render/project/src/` but our files are in the root directory.

## ✅ Solution

### Option 1: Update Render Settings (Recommended)

1. **Go to your Render dashboard**
2. **Click on your service**
3. **Go to Settings**
4. **Update the following settings:**

```
Build Command: bash build.sh
Publish Directory: public
Root Directory: (leave empty)
```

### Option 2: Use Static Site Without Build Command

1. **Change service type to Static Site**
2. **Set these settings:**
   ```
   Build Command: (leave empty)
   Publish Directory: public
   Root Directory: (leave empty)
   ```
3. **Make sure the `public` folder is committed to git**

### Option 3: Fix with render.yaml

The `render.yaml` file has been updated with the correct configuration. If you're using Blueprint deployment:

1. **Delete the current service**
2. **Redeploy using the render.yaml file**

## 🔧 Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Update Render Service Settings
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Click on your `content-pipeline-dashboards` service
3. Click "Settings"
4. Update:
   - **Build Command**: `bash build.sh` (or leave empty)
   - **Publish Directory**: `public`
   - **Root Directory**: (leave empty)
5. Click "Save Changes"

### Step 2: Trigger Manual Deploy
1. Click "Manual Deploy" in your service dashboard
2. Select "Deploy latest commit"
3. Wait for deployment to complete

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
1. Check the build logs for success
2. Visit your service URL
3. Test all dashboard links

## 📁 File Structure

Make sure your repository has this structure:
```
Content-Pipeline/
├── public/                     # Static files (created by build)
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── monitoring.html
│   ├── robots.txt
│   └── sitemap.xml
├── docs/                       # Source HTML files
│   ├── final-system-status-dashboard.html
│   ├── 24-7-monitoring-dashboard.html
│   └── monitoring-dashboard.html
├── package.json               # Dependencies
├── build.sh                   # Build script
├── render.yaml               # Render configuration
└── server.js                 # Express server (optional)
```

## 🚀 Alternative: Deploy Without Build

If you want to deploy without any build process:

1. **Make sure `public` folder exists and is committed to git**
2. **Set Build Command to empty**
3. **Set Publish Directory to `public`**
4. **Deploy**

## ✅ Expected Result

After the fix, you should see:
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ Static files are served from `/public` directory
- ✅ Dashboard hub loads at root URL
- ✅ Monitoring dashboard loads at `/monitoring`
- ✅ All links work correctly

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If build still fails:
1. Check that `build.sh` is executable
2. Verify all source files exist in `docs/` directory
3. Check Render build logs for specific errors

### If files don't load:
1. Verify `public` directory contains the HTML files
2. Check that Publish Directory is set to `public`
3. Test URLs directly: `https://your-app.onrender.com/index.html`
